                        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to 
                        make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

                        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, HexaByt Software Development Service) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the

                        (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the
